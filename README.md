Phoenix Host Application

## Initial Release

This app is the first app developed for the Phoenix POS System. 
It will allow the host of the restaurant or bar to seat guests, 
and notify the server that a table in their section has been sat. 
This will help to improve communication between the host and servers,
and allow to staff to provide better service.

## Version A

In version A of this app, I created a Restfull API to provide that data that I had hardcoded in
the original version. This will allow me to create app that will allow me to make data more dynamic, and more
easily changed for different restaurants. Version B of the app will include to communication
functions between the host and servers.

## Version B

In version of this app, I implemented Firebase to enable the login of users and the notification of 
the servers. This version include the ability to register a user with firestore auth to use the app
with firestore capabilities. In future versions, this registration will be removed in favor of a 
separate app for registration.
