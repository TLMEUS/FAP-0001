Phoenix Host Application

## Getting Started

This app is the first app developed for the Phoenix POS System. 
It will allow the host of the restaurant or bar to seat guests, 
and notify the server that a table in their section has been sat. 
This will help to improve communication between the host and servers,
and allow to staff to provide better service.
